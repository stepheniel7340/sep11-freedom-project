Fermentation is a chemical process involving the breakdown of substances by bacteria, yeast, and other microorganisms.

There are 3 main types of fermentation
Lactic Acid Fermentation: Yeasts and bacteria convert starches or sugars into lactic acid in foods like sauerkraut, kimchi, pickles, yogurt and sourdough bread.

Ethyl Alcohol Fermentation: Pyruvate molecules in starches or sugars are broken down by yeasts into alcohol and carbon dioxide molecules to produce wine and beer.

Acetic Acid Fermentation: Starches or sugars from grains or fruit into sour tasting vinegar and condiments. This is the difference, for example, between apple cider vinegar and apple cider.
